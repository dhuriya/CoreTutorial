# What are the View Components in ASP.NET Core MVC?
View Components in ASP.NET Core MVC are used to create reusable 
components that can encapsulate rendering logic and data fetching 
logic independently from views, and they can be called from different 
places like from Controller action methods, from views, and from Razor 
Pages. They are similar to partial views, but they can have their own 
logic, making them suitable for creating dynamic content that requires 
processing.

# What Are All Files Available in a View Component in ASP.NET Core MVC?
* Server-Side File (.cs file): Contains the logic to retrieve or 
  prepare data.
* Client Side File (.cshtml file): Renders the output, similar to how 
  a partial view works.
