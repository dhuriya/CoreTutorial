# What are HTML Helpers in ASP.NET Core MVC?
HTML Helpers in ASP.NET Core MVC are methods used in Razor views to generate 
HTML elements dynamically. They provide a way to render standard HTML 
elements programmatically, which helps reduce the amount of manual HTML code 
we have to write in our views.

# Types of HTML Helpers in ASP.NET Core MVC
HTML Helpers can be categorized into three types:
1 Standard HTML Helpers:
 These helpers generate basic HTML elements such as text boxes, checkboxes, 
 radio buttons, etc. Examples include

Html.TextBox()
Html.TextArea()
Html.DropDownList()

Strongly Typed HTML Helpers:
Html.TextBoxFor(model => model.PropertyName)
Html.EditorFor(model => model.PropertyName)
Html.DropDownListFor(model => model.PropertyName)

Custom HTML Helpers:
You can create custom HTML helpers by defining reusable methods to generate 
specific HTML markup. These helpers are typically used when you need custom 
functionality that the built-in helpers do not provide.

# TextBoxFor() HTML Helper Method in ASP.NET Core MVC Application:
The TextBoxFor() HTML helper is a strongly typed HTML helper method in ASP.NET 
Core MVC that generates a text input element for a form. This helper method 
binds a model property to a text box,

# What are the Differences Between Html.TextBox and Html.TextBoxFor in ASP.NET 
Core MVC?
Model Binding
Html.TextBox: It is not strongly typed and does not bind directly to a model’s 
property. Instead, we need to specify the field’s name as a string used to 
generate the <input> element.

Html.TextBoxFor: It is strongly typed and binds directly to a specific model 
property using a lambda expression.

Type Safety
Html.TextBox: Since it takes the field name as a string, it is not type-safe.
You can accidentally misspell the field name, and this error will only be 
caught at runtime. 

Html.TextBoxFor: Being strongly typed, it is type-safe. The lambda expression 
refers directly to a model property, so any issues will be caught at compile 
time. 

# what is a ListBox
A Listbox in web applications is an input element that allows to select one or more items from 
a list displayed within a box.
